# Job req

## 1. React [x]

- Component Structure: Organize code by splitting it into smaller, reusable components.
- Hooks: Master hooks like useState, useEffect, and custom hooks for managing state and side effects.
- State Management: Handle component-level state and lift it up where needed. For larger apps, consider global state management like Redux Toolkit.
- Performance Optimization: Use React.memo, lazy loading, and splitting code for better performance.

## 2. React-Router-Dom [x]

- Routing Basics: Learn to set up routes using BrowserRouter, Route, and Link.
- Dynamic Routing: Understand how to create dynamic routes and access route parameters using useParams.
- Protected Routes: Implement authentication using protected routes to restrict access to certain parts of the application.

## 3. Redux Toolkit

- Slices: Break down your global state into slices. Each slice manages a specific part of the state.
- Async Thunks: Handle side effects like API calls using createAsyncThunk.
- Selectors: Optimize component rendering by using selectors to fetch only necessary parts of the state.
- Middleware: Learn to customize the behavior of Redux actions using middleware.

## 4. Project Configuration [x]

- File Structure: Organize files into folders like components, pages, services, assets, etc.
- Environment Variables: Use .env files for environment-specific variables like API keys.
- Code Quality: Use tools like ESLint, Prettier, and Husky for linting, formatting, and pre-commit hooks.
- Build Tools: Understand Webpack or Vite to optimize your project builds.

## 5. MongoDB Basics

- Documents & Collections: Understand the structure of MongoDB, which stores data in BSON documents inside collections.
- CRUD Operations: Learn the basics of insert, find, update, and delete operations.
- Indexes: Know when and how to use indexes to improve query performance.
- Schema Design: Design schemas that are efficient and avoid deep nesting to enhance performance.

## 6. MySQL Basics

- SQL Queries: Master basic SQL queries like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.
- Joins: Learn how to use different types of joins (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT) to fetch related data from multiple tables.
- Indexes: Understand indexing and how it improves performance in MySQL databases.
- Normalization: Practice normalizing database tables to reduce redundancy and maintain data integrity.

## 7. Modular Project Structure

- Feature Modules: Divide your project into independent modules, each managing a specific feature.
- Service Layer: Keep all API and business logic separate from your UI by creating service layers.
- Container Components: Use container components to manage state and logic, and pass it down to presentational components.
- Dependency Injection: If needed, implement dependency injection for better testability and flexibility.

# *Practice these concepts by building small projects that utilize a modular structure, state management, and database integration. This will help you solidify your understanding.*
